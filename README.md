# US-Medical-Insurance-Costs
Part of a CodeAcademy off-platform self-learning exam to demonstrate the use of Python, Jupyter Notebook, and GitHub

I started this project as a formal assessment as if I were producing it for work, hence the tone of the document being as it is

I have included a HTML export of the notebook as I was keen to view it as a finished product outside of Jupyter
