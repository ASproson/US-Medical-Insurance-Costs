# US-Medical-Insurance-Costs
Part of a CodeAcademy off-platform self-learning exam to demonstrate the use of Python, PowerBI, Jupyter Notebook, and GitHub

I started this project as a formal assessment as if I were producing it for my day job as an analyst. I have also used PowerBI to include some additional graphs and analysis as the project didn't feel complete just using Python and markdown text (PowerBI is not covered within Codeacademy)

I have included a HTML export of the notebook as I was keen to view it as a finished product outside of Jupyter, and to also make access to my project easier for none jupyter users
